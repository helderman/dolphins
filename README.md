### Notes and Credits

I designed a simplified 3D model of something that resembles a dolphin,
entirely made up of spheres and stadiums,
and reproducible by relatively simple mathematical formulas,
making it straightforward and efficient to be drawn by pen.

Tuning the formulas that represent the 3D shape,
I spent many hours studying this drawing of a dolphin's body:

The image is part of the article "Marine Mammals & The Physics of Aquatic Life"
by Daniela Wilner, April 9, 2012.

According to the article, the figure came from a scientific paper by Fish et al. from 2008.

'Dolphins' title and scrolling background have been generated by
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) 2.8.10
through Script-Fu
([TinyScheme](http://tinyscheme.sourceforge.net/home.html) version 1.40).
I used gradient 'Horizon 2', font 'Sans' and a lot of filters;
see the [makefile](https://github.com/helderman/dolphins/blob/master/makefile).

Thanks to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin) for most of the trivia.

I got the idea for this project after receiving an invitation for the
[art contest for Void of the Ocean](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/2925241/)
